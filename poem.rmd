Never think that hours of play

In the quiet dawn, a whispering breeze,

Dances through the leaves with effortless ease.

Golden light kisses the morning dew,

Awakening dreams that the night once knew.

Birds compose a symphony in the trees,

Melodies mingling with the rustling seas.

A tapestry of colors paints the sky,

As the sun ascends, bidding stars goodbye.

Footsteps wander on a sandy shore,

Tracing tales of those who've walked before.

Waves embrace the land with gentle grace,

Erasing lines in an endless chase.

Flowers bloom in gardens rich and wide,

Nature's artistry, a world inside.

Butterflies drift on a fragrant breeze,

Lost in the rhythm of swaying trees.

As day gives way to twilight's embrace,

Stars emerge to take their place.

The moon whispers secrets to the night,

Guiding dreams with its silvery light.
